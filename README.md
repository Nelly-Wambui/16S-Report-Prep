# 16S-Report-Prep

nf-core/ampliseq pipeline
* A bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for amplicon sequencing, supporting denoising of any amplicon and, currently, taxonomic assignment of 16S, ITS and 18S amplicons. 
* Supported is paired-end Illumina or single-end Illumina, PacBio and IonTorrent data. 
* Default is the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequenced paired-end with Illumina.
* The pipeline is built using Nextflow.
* It runs with Conda, Docker, and Singularity.
