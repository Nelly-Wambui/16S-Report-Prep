# 16S-Report-Prep

## nf-core/ampliseq pipeline
* [Link to the pipeline github repository](https://github.com/nf-core/ampliseq)
* It is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for amplicon sequencing, supporting denoising of any amplicon and, currently, taxonomic assignment of 16S, ITS and 18S amplicons. 
* Supported is paired-end Illumina or single-end Illumina, PacBio and IonTorrent data. 
* Default is the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequenced paired-end with Illumina.
* The pipeline is built using Nextflow.
* It runs with Conda, Docker, Podman,Shifter, Charliecloud and Singularity.
* It can run on the AWS cloud infrastructure.
* Command for running the pipeline:
  ```
  nextflow run nf-core/ampliseq -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> --input "path to data" --FW_primer "forward primer sequence" --RV_primer "reverse primer sequence" --metadata "Path to metadata file""
  ```

## MBBU 16S-Accreditation
* This is a workflow for 16SrRNA analysis.
* There are pipelines for Dada2 and Qiime and can be found [here](https://github.com/mbbu/16S_Accreditation/blob/main/Dada2_report.md)
* The Dada2 pipeline is written in R, while the Qiime pipeline is built with Nextflow.
